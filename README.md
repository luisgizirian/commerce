### [still-editing] Mongo DB manual DB initialization (until automated comes...)

1. Run the App (it'll create DB + Collection in MongoDB Container). No results rendered.
2. Head your browser to http://localhost:5002
2. Get a Console for the running MongoDB container  with `docker exec -it <CONTAINER> /bin/bash`

```
> mongosh

> use cmmrcdb

> db.Catalog.insertMany([{"Name": "Albahaca", "Sku": "001", "IsEnabled": true}, {"Name": "Alcachofa", "Sku": "002"}])
```
4. Reload the webpage (1 result must be rendered).
5. Do (replacing first, `<SECOND_OBJECT_ID>` with the second value obtained after previous command run):
```
> db.Catalog.updateOne({ "_id": ObjectId("<SECOND_OBJECT_ID>") }, {$set: { "Name": "Alcachofa", "Sku": "002", "IsEnabled": true }})
```
6. Reload the webpage to see 2 results listed

Now, you can stop/remove/start docker-compose with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build` command. You'll notice that heading to http://localhost:5002 gets you 2 listed results. This is because MongoDB container is using a persisted volume outside its boundaries. NOTE: this will later become be the basis for local/manual backup.
